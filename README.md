### Assigment 1:  Predictive Modeling on Tabular Data
In this assignment, the predictive model is built to predict the price of an Airbnb by training
the model on the data set of around 9k Airbnb apartments in Belgium. Our main goal is to
construct a prediction model with the least RMSE(Root mean square error) in predicting the
Airbnb price. We will create the model with three algorithms: Random Forests, XGBoost and
a Neural Network. Then select the model with the least RMSE score. The coding part of
the assignment is coded on Jupyter using Python.

### Assignment 2: Deep Learning on Images
In the second assignment, deep learning on image classification via a pre-trained Convolutional Neural
Network is explored on a dataset containing nearly 117K images from restaurants from the
Michelin Guide. Our main goal is to construct a CNN prediction model to classify whether one
image shows food or the restaurantâ€™s interior. The project is developed via Pytorch which is a
well-known deep learning framework in Python due to its superior flexibility and accessibility,
and all the codes of this project are public on Github.

### Assignment 3: Predicting on Streamed Textual Data
This part of the assignment aims at constructing a predictive model using Spark (Structured)
Streaming and textual data. The dataset is based on Steam which the model will predict the
score (upvote or downvote) based on the game reviews of the newly released game by the user.

### Assignment 4: Graph Analytics
In the fourth assignment, we conducted network analysis on a graphical dataset scrapped
from Twitch, a popular live streaming service platform majorly focusing on video game live
streaming. The main objective of this assignment is to investigate the underlying community
structure-property of streamers on Twitch via community detection algorithm. More specifi-
cally, we aim to perform a community mining analysis on both regular streamers and blocked
streamers based on games and tags associated with them, to analyze whether blocked streamers
present any noticeable patterns in terms of games and tags they used. Furthermore, we could
also identify some potential factors that contribute streamers to be blocked by Twitch from the
above graphic analytics process.
